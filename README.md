# Name
Computational Genomics - recombination of several small coding projects focusing on the computational genomics within python based coding environment.

# Purpose
* Learn the basic computational genomics knowledge
* Reorgnize the python based coding course assignment in Duke *COMPSCI 260* based on computational genomics topics

For detailed information, check `README.md` in each sub-directories.

# Directory organization
* [`programming-basic/`](programming-basic/): Brute force algorithm, divide and conquer algorithm, dynamic programming algorithm, greedy algorithm based problems. Focusing on the practice of python implement of different algorithms which would be used in the future.

* [`genome-assembly-mapping/`](genome-assembly-mapping/):
